# What is this repository?

Hello fellow bioinformaticians (and non-bioinformaticians)!

In this repo you will find the solutions to all the rosalind - a bioinformatics learning platform - exercises I have tried to tackle.
For more information on rosalind, visit their webpage [here](https://rosalind.info/about/).

Each problem is represented by a short identifier, f.e. 'dna' for the problem 'counting dna nucleotides'.
Conveniently, each folder in this repo has the identifier as its name. 
The problem description can always be found at: 
https://rosalind.info/problems/, 
followed by the id of the problem.

In each folder you will (most likely) find a python file called 'main.py'. 
All instructions to run the script properly should be provided in that main file.
Additionally, you can sometimes find 'test.txt' files that were used for testing purposes, 
and a file called 'rosalind_<problem_id>.txt' that contains the input provided by rosalind. 
This is what rosalind uses to check your solution.
