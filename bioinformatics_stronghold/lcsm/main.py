This file takes a collection of DNA sequences in FASTA format and returns the longest common subsequence.

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.
Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, 
you may return any single solution.)

Run this script by using the following command:
`python3 main.py fasta_file`
Where fasta_file is the path to your fasta file.
