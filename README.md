Hello fellow bioinformaticians (and non-bioinformaticians)!

In this repo you will find the solutions to all the rosalind exercises I have tried to tackle.
See https://rosalind.info/about/ for more info.

Each problem is represented by a short identifier, f.e. 'dna' for the problem 'counting dna nucleotides'. 
The problem description can always be found at: 
https://rosalind.info/problems/<problem_identifier>/

In each folder you will find (most likely) a python file called 'main.py'. In that file, all instructions to run the script properly are provided.
Additionally, you can sometimes find 'test.txt' files which were used for tesing purposes, and a file called 'rosalind_<problem_id>' that contains the 
input provided by rosalind. This is what rosalind uses to check your solution.
